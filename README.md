Project Name:

 Task Scheduler

Description:

This project implements a web-based task scheduling application using Java JSP, MySQL, and Priority Queues. It enables users to create, manage, and prioritize tasks effectively.

Technologies:

    Frontend: Java Server Pages (JSP)
    Backend: Java
    Database: MySQL
    Data Structure: Priority Queue

Features:

    Task Creation: Users can create new tasks with details like title, description, and priority.
    Task Management: Users can view
    Priority Queue: Tasks are stored in a priority queue based on their due date and priority level, ensuring that the most important tasks are displayed first.
    MySQL Database: Tasks are persisted in a MySQL database for data integrity and scalability.

Project Setup:

    Prerequisites: Ensure you have Java (JDK and JRE), a text editor or IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA), and MySQL server installed on your system.
    Database Setup:
        Create a MySQL database for your project (e.g., task_scheduler).
        Create a table named tasks with appropriate columns to store task data (e.g., id, title, description, due_date, priority).
    Project Structure:
        Create a project directory with subdirectories for:
            src/main/java: Java source code for application logic
            src/main/webapp: JSP files for the user interface
            WEB-INF: Deployment descriptor (web.xml) and other configuration files
            resources: Database connection properties file (e.g., db.properties)

Implementation Details:

    Java Classes:
        Develop Java classes to handle:
            Task: Represents a task with its attributes (title, description, due date, priority).
            TaskManager: Manages task operations (create, read, update, delete).
            DatabaseConnection: Establishes connection to the MySQL database.
            PriorityQueue: Implements the priority queue data structure (can be a custom implementation or use an existing Java library).
    JSP Pages:
        Create JSP pages for:
            Home: Displays a list of tasks according to their priority.
            CreateTask: Form to add new tasks
            ViewTask: Detailed view of a specific task.
    Database Connection:
        Use JDBC to connect to the MySQL database using connection details stored in the db.properties file.
    Priority Queue:
        Implement a priority queue data structure to efficiently store and retrieve tasks based on their priority.
    Task Management:
        Develop logic in Java classes to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on tasks.
        Utilize the priority queue to ensure tasks are retrieved and displayed in the correct order.
